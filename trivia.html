  <p>
    In Spain, people have a <span style="color: blue;">given name</span> (<em>nombre</em>) and two <span style="color: red;">family names</span> or surnames (<em>apellidos</em>), each one of these corresponding to the first surname of each parent.<br>
    My full name is, then: <span style="color: blue;">Miguel</span> <span style="color: red;">Muñoz Pérez</span>.
    <br><br>
    My preferred way of signing is 'M. Muñoz Pérez', even if sometimes I may appear as 'M. M. Pérez' or as 'M. Muñoz-Pérez' in some places. I would cite my own papers by refering to the first surname, i.e. as [MuXX].
